# countdown-arduino
You can use this code to run a countdown timer on 8-segment LED digital number. This code is for 2 minutes digits and 2 seconds digits, so 4 LED digital numbers will be needed. I have not written the pin numbers and have added comments for where pin numbers need to be included so that you can enter pin numbers on the basis of your circuit.
